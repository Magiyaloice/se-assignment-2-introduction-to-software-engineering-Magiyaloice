# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the sysytematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering is a systematic approach to buiding software.It is different from traditional engineering in a lot of ways, traditional engineering deals with tangible products , for example machines, while software engineering deals with intangible products like applications, frameworks

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Software Development Life Cycle has various phases which include:
 Requirements -.in this phase requirements gathered during the planning stage are analyzedin detail
 Design -focuses on creating a design according to the user needs
 Implemantation -coding and building the software
 Testing -this phase is about verifying that the software meets quality standards.
 Depolyment - it is when the software is released to the users
 Maintanance - providing on going support and updates to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering: 

Agile is flexible and iterative while waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach. Agile is preffered for changing requirements while waterfall is preffered for projects with well driven requirements

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements engineering is a process of planning gathering, documenting and maintaining the requirements software system.
The process consists of including the following:
1 Requirements gathering 
2 Requirements analysis
3 Requirements specification
4 Requirements verification
5 requirements validation
6 management of the project lifecycle.
The process is important to ensure that the software project is well defined 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity is a concept that involves breaking down a large program into smaller independent modules.
Modules can be easily maintained without affecting the entire system
System can easily be extended by adding new modules.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems: 

Unit testing is testing of individual components of software,to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
Integration testing is testing the interaction between different components to ensure seamless intergration.
System testing is testing the entire system as awhole to verify its perfomance,functionality and security
Acceptance testing , tests whether the software meets the user's expsctations and requirements

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version control systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among members.Example is Git which is known for its speed and a vast ecosystem of tools and services

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

A software project manager oversees the planning, execution,and delivery of software projects. Challenges they may face include, changing environments during the development cycle leading to project delays.tight deadlines to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Software maintenance refers to the activities involved in Modifying, updating,and ensuring the continued perfomance of existing software applications.
Maintenance activities include:
  corrective maintenance - fixing bugs or errors
  adaptive maintenance - modifying software 
  perfective maintenance -enhancing software 
  preventive maintenance - identifying and adressing potential issues to prevent future problems.
Maintenance is crucial part of the software lifecycle to ensure reliability, security, compatibility and compliance of software applications.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? 
 
 Ethical issues faced by software engineers may include, privacy concerns, bias and fairness, unethical data collection,security.
 to ensure that software engineers adhere to ethical standards, training may be offered regularly to encourage ethical behaviours
 Trade certification may also help.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
